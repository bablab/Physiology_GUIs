This application is intended for manual editing of ECG data from .Acq files. 
The GUI allows for manual checking and editting of R-peaks which are initially detected using the Neurokit2 (Makowski et al., 2020).

The application generates 2 output files: 

  1) the filtered ECG signal
    
  2) the finalized set of R-peaks

These files can then be used for ECG-based analyses (e.g., IBI, HRV, ect.)
